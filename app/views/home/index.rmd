===Online or Offline, Rebol is here to Help

The Rebol binary ships with documentation of each function's purpose,
the allowable types of parameters and return values, and descriptive strings
for parameters.  This information is always available with the HELP function:

===Launch help.rebol.org pages Direct from the Interpreter

Additional documentation, such as example code, is available here on
help.rebol.org. If you're online you can tell the HELP command to open a 
browser at the right place...

===Rebol's help facility extends to your functions, too

When functions are specified in Rebol, their parameters and return types
are defined using what is known as the "function specification dialect".
This offers many interesting features (like defining an interface
in a variable and reusing it whole or in part), but you can also place Rebol
strings in certain positions:

The interpreter stores the specification and when you request HELP
on your function, generates a readable description:

    (show help output when run on previous function definition)

Rebolers are on StackOverflow Q&A and chat 24 hours a day

Rebol's friendly and enthusiastic community is worldwide, and almost
always someone is online to answer questions.  So if something
isn't clear from the help pages, don't hesitate to come and ask!
